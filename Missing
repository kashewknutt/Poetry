I miss standing by the window
Talking to the clouds
Requesting the wind
To send you over
I miss pulling you towards me
While you close your eyes
Waiting for the perfect spice
The kiss of our lives
I miss holding you in my arms
While staring into your eyes
Your perfect body
Gently pressed against mine
I miss hugging you
Pouring kisses, tracing your neckline
I miss how my heart stuck to you 
Every moment you smiled
I even miss you going away
Still am an enemy of time
And although they were small,
I miss those brief moments
When i was yours and you were mine
