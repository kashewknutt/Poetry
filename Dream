//Ed Sheeran's Perfect's tune

Its 443
Could be just you and me
But I'm wide awake
With you in my dream
You say your with me
But why cant you see
That even the moon rides the sky
and the sun doesn't meet

I know I said I would wait,
One day you will be my mate,
Its just that the pain everyday,
Is cries,

Don't I'll bear this date,
I don't need for you to explain,
I know I'll keep falling away,
In your eyes,

Baby....
