I grew up.

Everyday explaining,
the constant paining,
the self-containing,
overflowing tearful cup.

You won't find it on the hedge,
it fell right down like an egg,
Just letting me to slip ahead,
and cry to death in every club.

We thought I'd stay hung over,
But turns out that I'm a glower,
Cuz I finally got closer,
To the mirror and my hub.
