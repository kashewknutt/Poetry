Good morning now, how is the you?
Is something that i used to do
To bid the broken ice adieu
And start a fresh relation new

But when i saw, my heart just flew
A stunning picture, my eyes just drew
A sweet nightingale, my ears knew
In a moment, i was stuck like glue

I stuttered, what an unnatural night,
Shrivels aside, my lion's mane
Didnt believe in love at first sight
So decided to walk by again
